# ANALYSIS-ON-AIRPLANE-PASSENGER-SATISFACTION-USING-ML

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting airline passenger satisfaction levels using classification machine learning models. The dataset includes passenger demographics, travel details, and service quality factors, aiming to help airlines enhance service standards and customer experience.

The study applies multiple classification algorithms and compares their performance to identify the most accurate model.

Methods & Models Applied

Classification Models:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest

Bagging & Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting)

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Evaluation Metric: Accuracy

Train/Test Split: 75:25

 Key Findings

The best-performing model was Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with:

Accuracy: 0.964

Train/Test Split: 75:25

Service quality (check-in, inflight service, cleanliness) had the strongest influence on satisfaction.
